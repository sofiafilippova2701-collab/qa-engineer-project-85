    title: "High latency in real‑time code synchronization during pair battles"
    description: |
      During pair programming battles, code updates from opponent are delayed by 2+ seconds (expected ≤500ms).
    steps_to_reproduce:
      - Start a pair battle with another user
      - Begin typing code in the editor
      - Observe delay in opponent's code updates

    description: |
      Under high load (≥1000 users), the system returns 502 Bad Gateway errors for 15% of requests.
    steps_to_reproduce:
      - Run a load test with 1000 virtual users
      - Simulate simultaneous login attempts
      - Monitor response codes and latency
