    title: "High latency in real‑time code synchronization during pair battles"
    description: |
      During pair programming battles, code updates from opponent are delayed by 2+ seconds (expected ≤500ms), which breaks the core interactive experience.
    steps_to_reproduce:
      - Start a pair battle with another user
      - Begin typing code in the editor
      - Observe delay in opponent's code updates (use stopwatch for measurement)

    title: "Mobile interface usability issues on small screens (≤320px)"
    description: |
      On mobile devices with screen width ≤320px, the interface becomes unusable due to:
      - Horizontal scrolling in task lists
      - Touch targets smaller than 44×44 px
      - Overlapping UI elements
    steps_to_reproduce:
      - Open the app on a device with 320×480px resolution (or use Chrome DevTools mobile mode)
      - Navigate to the 'Tasks' section
      - Attempt to tap interface elements (filters, task cards)
      - Switch to 'Profile' page and check layout

      1. Implement CSS media query for max‑width: 320px
      2. Increase touch target sizes to minimum 44×44 px
      3. Replace horizontal scroll with vertical stacking for task filters

    title: "Server instability under 1000+ concurrent users"
    description: |
      Under high load (≥1000 users), the system returns 502 Bad Gateway errors for 15% of requests and exhibits:
      - Increased response times (up to 8 s)
      - Database connection timeouts
      - Memory spikes on application servers
    steps_to_reproduce:
      - Run a load test with 1000 virtual users
      - Simulate simultaneous login attempts
      - Monitor response codes and latency
      - Check server resource usage (CPU/RAM/connections)

      1. Increase database connection pool size
      2. Add caching layer for authenticated sessions
      3. Implement auto‑scaling for web instances
      4. Optimize slow database queries (identify via EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
